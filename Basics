Python 101

## Basic Commands

  print() - displays
  return() - returns output (useful in functions)
  type() - what kind of variable 
  range() - lists the range of values list(range(10)) [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
  len() - returns the length (the number of items) of an object. 
          The argument may be a sequence (such as a string, bytes, tuple, list, or range) or a collection (such as a dictionary, set, or frozen set)
  list() - mutable sequence type
  
  
## Functions

  Built-in Functions: https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html 

  def function1(input1, input2):
    variable = input1 + input2
    return variable
    print("your variable is " + str(variable))

## Boolean Variables & if Statements

  * True and False are the only bool types, and any variable that is assigned one of these values is called a boolean variable.
    set_to_true = True
    set_to_false = False
    
    bool_one = 5 != 7 
    
  * Relational Operators
    
    == equals
    != not equals
    > greater than
    >= greater than or equal to
    < less than
    <= less than or equal to
    
  * Understanding boolean variables and expressions is essential because they are the building blocks of conditional statements. 

    if variable1 == 5:
      print("True") 
    
  * Boolean Operators

    and - combines two boolean expressions and evaluates as True if both its components are True, but False otherwise.
       
       if variable1 == 5 and variable2 >=4:
        print("True") 
      
    or - combines two expressions into a larger expression that is True if either component is True.
    
        if variable1 == 5 or variable2 >=4:
         print("True") 
    
    not - when applied to any boolean expression it reverses the boolean value. Add 'not' statement at the beginning 
          So if we have a True statement and apply a not operator we get a False statement.
          
        if not variable1 ==5:
         print("True")
        if not (variable1 ==5) and not (variable2 >=2):
         print("False")
       
     else - these statements allow us to elegantly describe what we want our code to do when certain conditions are not met.
            'else' statements always appear in conjunction with if statements.
            
        def same_name(your_name, my_name):
          if (your_name == my_name):
            return True
          else:
            return False
            
     elif - 'else if' checks another condition after the previous if statements conditions aren’t met.
              Use to control the order we want our program to check each of our conditional statements.
              
         if donation >= 1000:
           print("You've achieved platinum status")
         elif donation >= 500:
           print("You've achieved gold donor status")
         else:
           print("You've achieved silver donor status")

      'if' statements can be used to create control flow in your code.
      'else' statements can be used to execute code when the conditions of an if statement are not met.
      'elif' statements can be used to build additional checks into your if statements

## For Statements

      for - Python’s 'for' statement iterates over the items of any sequence (a list or a string), in the order that they appear in the sequence.
         
         words = ['cat', 'window', 'defenestrate']
          for w in words:
              print(w, len(w))
         
         Code that modifies a collection while iterating over that same collection can be tricky to get right. 
         Instead, it is usually more straight-forward to loop over a copy of the collection or to create a new collection:
         
         # Strategy:  Iterate over a copy
            for user, status in users.copy().items():
                if status == 'inactive':
                    del users[user]

          # Strategy:  Create a new collection
            active_users = {}
            for user, status in users.items():
                if status == 'active':
                    active_users[user] = status
      
      range - If you do need to iterate over a sequence of numbers, the built-in function range() comes in handy. 
              It generates arithmetic progressions:
          
          for i in range(5):
            print(i)
