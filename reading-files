* Text Files

    with open('welcome.txt') as text_file:
      text_data = text_file.read()
      print(text_data)
      
* Iterating through lines w/ readlines.()

  with open('keats_sonnet.txt') as keats_sonnet:
    for line in keats_sonnet.readlines():
      print(line)
      
* Reading Lines
  
  with open('millay_sonnet.txt') as sonnet_doc:
    first_line = sonnet_doc.readline()
    second_line = sonnet_doc.readline()
    print(second_line)
    
* Writing a File

  with open('generated_file.txt', 'w') as gen_file:
    gen_file.write("What an incredible file!")
    
    - Here we pass the argument 'w' to open() in order to indicate to open the file in write-mode
    - The default argument is 'r' and passing 'r' to open() opens the file in read-mode as we’ve been doing
    
* Appending a File

    - One way to just add a line to a file without completely deleting it, we open it with 'a' for append-mode
    
      with open('generated_file.txt', 'a') as gen_file:
        gen_file.write("... and it still is")
        
* With "with"

    - The with keyword invokes something called a context manager for the file that we’re calling open() on
    - This context manager takes care of opening the file when we call open() and then closing the file after we leave the indented block
    - 'with' is preferred over using open() and close() 
    
    with open('fun_file.txt') as close_this_file: 
      setup = close_this_file.readline()
      punchline = close_this_file.readline()
      print(setup)
      
* CSV Files

    with open('logger.csv') as log_csv_file:
      print(log_csv_file.read())
   
   import csv
 
   list_of_email_addresses = []   ## creates empty list
   with open('users.csv', newline='') as users_csv:   ## Open CSV file w/temporary variable
      user_reader = csv.DictReader(users_csv)    ## converts the lines of our CSV file to python dictionaries
      for row in user_reader:
        list_of_email_addresses.append(row['Email'])
    
    import csv

    with open('cool_csv.csv') as cool_csv_file:
      cool_csv_dict = csv.DictReader(cool_csv_file)
      for row in cool_csv_dict:
        print(row["Cool Fact"])
