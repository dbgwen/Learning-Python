## Strings in Python

    - A string is a sequence of characters contained within a pair of 'single quotes' or "double quotes"
    - A string can be any length and can contain any letters, numbers, symbols, and spaces
  
* Strings can be thought of as lists

    - You can index a single letter from any string

    my_name = "Joey Jo Jo"
    first_initial = my_name[0]
    print(first_initial)
    
* Slicing Strings

   - If we remove the first index, the slice starts at the beginning of the string  
      
      string_variable[:4]
      
   - If we remove the second index the slice continues to the end of the string
       
       string_variable[4:]
       
* Concatenating Strings

   def account_generator(first_name, last_name):
      new_account = first_name[0:3] + last_name[0:3]
      return new_account

      new_account = account_generator(first_name, last_name)
      print(new_account)
      
* Using len() to slice

      Using a len() statement as the starting index 
        and omitting the final index lets you slice n characters from the end of a string, where n is the amount you subtract from len()
        
       length = len(favorite_fruit)
       last_chars = favorite_fruit[length-4:]
       print(last_chars)
       
* Negative Indices

      favorite_fruit[-3:] - slices the last three characters of 'blueberry'
     
* Strings are Immutable

    - They cannot be changed once they are created
    - They can be used to create other things 
    
* Escape Characters

    - By adding a backslash in front of the special character we want to escape, \", we can include it in a string
    
* Iterating Through Strings

    - Can iterate through strings using 'for' and 'while' loops
    
      def print_each_letter(word):
        for letter in word:
          print(letter)
    
* Strings and Conditionals

    favorite_fruit = "blueberry"
    counter = 0
    for character in favorite_fruit:
      if character == "b":
        counter = counter + 1
    print(counter)
